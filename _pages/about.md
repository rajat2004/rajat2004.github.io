I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Tower Research Capital in the Core Engineering division, focusing on low-latency front-office components. Most of my day-to-day work is in C++, with sprinkling of Python, Shell scripting for extra flavour. Prior to that I graduated from IIT Madras with a Bachelors in Computer Science.

I'm interested in building low latency systems, Operating Systems, designing for scalability and also dabble a bit in Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Robotics and Systems Engineering.

Bit of older history, I've been a part of the open-source community since around 2019, having started with exploring robotics. Since then, I have participated in GSoC 2019 with [ArduPilot.org](https://ardupilot.org/), a versatile open autopilot software for drones and other autonomous systems. My main work during GSoC was to add support for [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim/)

Reading books is one of my major hobbies, and I enjoy reading technical books and fiction novels (primarily fantasy, and also exploring SciFi, LitRPG). I've also recently started focusing more on my health and going to gym regularly, and play Table Tennis, Badminton recreationally.

Reach out if you want to discuss anything related to programming, tech or even novels (ps. reading Malazan Book of the Fallen currently)!
