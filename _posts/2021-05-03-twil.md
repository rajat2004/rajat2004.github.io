Second post in This Week I Learnt (or Worked on) series.

## Open-Source

Worked a bit on cleaning up some obvious inefficiencies in the AirSim-ArduPilot interface. 2 PRs currently in this, first is [PR #3656: ArduPilot: Reduce data copying, stack memory usage](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3656), the PR description explains the improvements. The other is [PR #3658: Return sensor data as const references rather than by value](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3658), this avoids extra unnecessary copies being made on reading the sensor data. Both of these are definitely not a performance bottleneck, but just simple easy fixes so why not.

Continuation of [last week's post](2021-04-26-twil.md), the [ArduPilot `airsim-non-gps` branch](https://github.com/rajat2004/ardupilot/tree/airsim-non-gps) has more commits on top to automatically switch between GPS and local NED position depending on the fields in the JSON packet. Looking at the parsing code now, I think it can be improved, especially the float array and `vector3f` array parsing, [`sscanf` can be accidentally O(n^2) in runtime](https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/). This again is not a serious performance bottleneck, but if it can be improved, best to do it. Plus the code will likely be cleaner than the original.

## Academics

Worked on a report for the [Bottom-up Context-Sensitive Pointer Analysis for Java](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/pubs/aplas15.pdf) paper. Now trying to think about how it can be extended for parallel programs and integrating the MHP analysis.

Completed implementing the MHP Analysis for [this assignment](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~krishna/cs6235/a2.html), using the algorithm described in [An Efficient Algorithm for Computing MHP Information for Concurrent Java Programs. Naumovich-Avrunin-Clarke. FSE 1999.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/318774.319252)

For a Secure Systems Engineering course, started working on a project implementing some of the concepts described in [Houdiniâ€™s Escape: Breaking the Resource Rein of Linux Control Groups](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3354227). I'm thinking of writing a few short blogs on this, should be interesting.

## Others

Read some articles on C++ and breaking ABI and its implications, an interesting one was [Jason Turner's C++ Weekly - Ep 270 - Break ABI to Save C++](https://youtu.be/By7b19YIv8Q). I don't have a very fixed opinion on this matter as such currently, but very interesting.

Digging into some performance improvements lead to reading a chapter in [Optimized C++](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/optimized-c/9781491922057/ch04.html), quite an informative one. Will try to adopt a similar approach for implementing the `sscanf` parsing improvement mentioned earlier and see the results.
