This is the first of (hopefully!) a series of weekly posts to keep track of what I'm working on and learnt in the current week.

## Open Source

I've been trying to get non-GPS navigation working with AirSim + ArduPilot. [PR 3364](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3364) provides a start wherein it doesn't crash if GPS is disabled (by excluding it in `settings.json`), however the ArduPilot SITL only flies in Stabilize mode.

Some basic implementation is ready on branches [AirSim/ap-non-gps](https://github.com/rajat2004/AirSim/tree/ap-non-gps) & [ardupilot/arisim-non-gps](https://github.com/rajat2004/ardupilot/tree/airsim-non-gps), but there are currently GPS prearm failures with GPS and non-GPS SITL. The strange problem I'm seeing is that the GPS altitude seems to jump from +100m to 0 in the data sent by AirSim. Release 1.3.0 doesn't seem to have this problem (GPS prearm is still an issue), might need to do kind of `git bisect` and see if any specific commit caused this, though I don't remember any such PRs.

Update: So I later figured out the problem, a very stupid mistake with the data encoding on the AirSim side, the comment history starts from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3364#issuecomment-826106220). [TLDR](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3364#issuecomment-827312752)

Also worked on running the AirSim ROS wrapper inside a docker container since my host installation is broken (old `opencv` source install, long story...). The final PR is at [#3635](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3635).
Did some code reivew of [Fix px4 connection for WSL 2](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3603), the PX4 backend is definitely becoming a huge beast.

[rpclib](https://github.com/rpclib/rpclib) has a new maintainer, and 2.3.0 release! Made PR [#3642](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3642) to change the rpclib version, lots of hardcoding in the scripts!

## Academics

Started reading [Distributed systems: for fun and profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/ebook.html), it's a free ebook on Distributed Systems as a beginner text, the content is pretty interesting and written in an easily understandable way.

For an Analysis of Parallel Programs course at my university, I'm currnetly implementing a May-Happen-in-Parallel (MHP) Analysis on a subset of Java. The assignment details are available [here](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~krishna/cs6235/a2.html).
Along with this, I've been going through some papers and lectures on Context-sensitive, flow-sensitive alias analysis for the course project. The final paper which I'm going to analyze is [Bottom-up Context-SensitivePointer Analysis for Java](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/pubs/aplas15.pdf).

### Others

Have been watching some videos and blog-posts on C++20 features, seems interesting but need to try them out.
